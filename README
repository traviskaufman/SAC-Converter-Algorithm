Today I reviewed Successive Approximation Digital to Analog Conversion, and after starting to learn my stuff with data structures I decided it would be cool to try and implement the Successive approximation algorithm in C++, since 1) C++ is really awesome, 2) I have a hunch I can get this bad boy to run in O(log n) time,  and 3) I am literally the biggest nerd on the planet. Therefore, here's my attempt at it. The algorithm is as follows:

1) Flip the MSB of the potential output word 
2) If the output word's value is larger than the reference voltage, flip the MSB back and repeat 1) with the next-most significant bit
3) If the output word's value is smaller than the reference voltage, flip the next-most significant bit and compare it with the reference voltage again, repeating steps 2) and 3) as necessary
4) If the output word equals the reference voltage, return it.

Obviously for the sake of my own sanity V1.0.0 will use integers, but maybe someday in the future it'll be cool to twiddle some floating-point numbers and see if I can fenagle it to get it working.
